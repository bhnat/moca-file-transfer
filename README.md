moca-file-transfer
==================
Use this software to transfer files between your local machine and a moca
server.  Currently, this only works with moca-ng, that is, using an 
HttpConnection.  You will need to obtain a copy of moca-core.jar and place 
it in your local maven repository before building this project.
